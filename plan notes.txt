- We want to create a website where users can acces a DB of UFO reports in the UK
        * The user is able to filter these events by date (most recent to oldest posted
        * The user is able to filter these events by Location
                                1) default: Alphabetically listed by town_village_city
                                2) //STRETCH: option to filter by County // when county name is typed
                                3) option to filter by user input when city/town name is typed
        * The user is able to see a page of events


- The user is able to create an account with a secure password by their choice
        * Once registered / logged in the user is able to add, delete and edit events to the existing DB
        * This will store the 1) date of event
                              2) first published on the site
                              3) last edit date
                              4) title of event (allow null : false)
                              5) town_village (allow null: false)
                              6) brief_description (allow null: false)
                              7) time of event (allow null : true?)
